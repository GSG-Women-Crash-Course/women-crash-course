## Layout In CSS üë©‚Äçüíª

the layout is how to organize the elements on your website such as put two divisions in the same row or to put the text beside the image.

CSS provides alot of techniques  to orgnizaed the position of elements in the page, like:

- float.
- inline-Block
- box model
- flexbox
- grid

in this session we will discuss float, inline-block, box model.

### Float

The ```float``` property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

The float property can have one of the following values:

- left - The element floats to the left of its container
- right - The element floats to the right of its container
- none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
- inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent

when ```float``` has value ```left``` then the element will position to left and if there is extra space for the next element then the next element will move to right: 

#### html

#### css

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tQJjju3.png" alt="final result" width="700" />

#### final result

> if the float get right as a value then the element will move to the right.

### clear.
The ```clea1r``` property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.

The clear property can have one of the following values:

- none - Allows floating elements on both sides. This is default
- left - No floating elements allowed on the left side
- right- No floating elements allowed on the right side
- both - No floating elements allowed on either the left or the right side
- inherit - The element inherits the clear value of its parent
The most common way to use the clear property is after you have used a float property on an element.

When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page.

```
.div1 {
  float: left;
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
  margin: 10px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}

.div2 {
  border: 1px solid red;
}

.div3 {
  float: left;
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
  margin: 10px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}

.div4 {
  border: 1px solid red;
  clear: left;
}
```

### Box Model:

do you know how ```margin```, ```padding```, ```border``` ?
I will assume you know them, so now let's dive deep and understand how they are working precisely.

**this is the box model**.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NmN7hEi.png" alt="final result" width="700" />

- **margin**: is the space between the border of the element and the surrounded elements (orange area).
**margin** is a shorthand for ```margin-top```, ```margin-right```, ```margin-bottom``` and ```margin-left```.
```css
h1 {
    /* This: */
    margin: 20px 10px 5px;
    /* Is the same as: */
    margin-top:20px;
    margin-right:10px;
    margin-bottom:5px;
    margin-left:10px;
} 
```
- **padding**: is the space between the content of the element and the border of the element (green area).
**padding** is a shorthand for ```padding-top```, ```padding-right```, ```padding-bottom``` and ```padding-left```.
```css
div {
    /* This: */
    margin: 20px;
    /* Is the same as: */
    margin-top:20px;
    margin-right:20px;
    margin-bottom:20px;
    margin-left:20px;

    /* This: */
    padding: 10px 20px;
    /* Is the same as: */
    padding-top:10px;
    padding-right:20px;
    padding-bottom:10px;
    padding-left:20px;
}
```

- **border**: is the space between the margin and the content of the element(yellow area).
- **width**: is the width of the content of the element.
- **height**: is the height of the content of the element.

>all these properties work if the element is not an inline element, if the element is inline then these properties will not work.

### display property

display property control how the element will interact with the other elements and has different values :

- **block**.
- **inline**.
- **inline-block**.

#### ```display: block```

here the element will presented as a block so the element will add a new line before and after it, in this case the element will follow the ```box model``` so we can control the ```width```, ```hight```, ```margin```, ```padding``` and ```border``` of the element.

#### ```display: inline```

here the element will not add a new lines before and after, and we can't control the ```width```, ```height```, ```padding```,```margin```, and border of the element.

#### ```display: inline-block```

here the element will be treated as ```inline``` but you can take control of ```width``` and ```height```.

## Display: inline-block
Compared to ```display: inline```, the major difference is that ```display: inline-block``` allows to set a ```width``` and ```height``` on the element.

Also, with ```display: inline-block```, the ```top``` and ```bottom``` ```margins```/```paddings``` are respected, but with ```display: inline``` they are not.

Compared to ```display: block```, the major difference is that ```display: inline-block``` does not add a ```line-break``` after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.

The following example shows the different behavior of ```display: inline```, ```display: inline-block``` and ```display: block```:

### Example:
```
span.a {
  display: inline; /* the default for span */
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  background-color: yellow;
}

span.b {  display: inline-block;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  background-color: yellow;
}

span.c {
  display: block;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

### Using inline-block to Create Navigation Links:
One common use for display: inline-block is to display list items horizontally instead of vertically. The following example creates horizontal navigation links:
```
.nav {
  background-color: yellow;
  list-style-type: none;
  text-align: center; 
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}

.nav li {
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

## inline-block vs float:
You can create a grid of boxes that fills the browser width and wraps nicely. This has been possible for a long time using float, but now with inline-block it's even easier. inline-block elements are like inline elements but they can have a width and height. Let's look at examples of both approaches.

### The Hard Way (using float):
```
.box {
  float: left;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 1em;
}
.after-box {
  clear: left;
}
```

### The Easy Way (using inline-block):
You can achieve the same effect using the inline-block value of the display property.
```
.box2 {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 1em;
}
```
