# Exercises

**Note:** you can use online editor to work on the following exercises. [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) for example.

## Exercise 1

Write a JavaScript `for loop` that will iterate from 0 to 15. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen.

**_Sample Output:_**

```js
"0 is even"
"1 is odd"
"2 is even"

## Exercise 2

**Note:** This exercise illustrates how to use nested loops. So if there is no time to solve it, then it should be homework and discussed later.

Write a JavaScript program to construct the following pattern, using a `nested for loop`.

**_Pattern:_**

```js
*

* * *
* * * *
