### What is a rule or "rule set"?

A rule or "rule set" is a statement that tells browsers how to render particular elements on an HTML page. A rule set consists of a selector followed by a declaration block.

```CSS
selector {
  property: value;
  property: value;
  property: value;
}
```

CSS Selectors:

part of the **_CSS Syntax_**, that use to select the element which you need to apply the style on it.

We have a lot of CSS selector but in this workshop we will talk about the basic CSS selectors.

### Basic CSS Selectors:

- Tag
- Id
- Class
- Universal selector

<br/>

**Tag:** selects the elements which has the same tag name, for example:

```CSS
p {
  color: blue;
}
```

_In this example:_ this style will be applied to all the `p` elements in your page.

- **#id:** selects the elements which have the same id name, for example:

```CSS
#id-1{
  font-size: 20px;
  border: 2px solid blue;
}
```

_In this example:_ this style will be applied to the element which has id `id`

- **.class:** selects the elements which have the same class name, for example:

```CSS
.class-1{
  font-weight: bold;
  color: darkblue;
}
```

_In this example:_ this style will be applied to all the elements which have the `class-1` class in your page.

- **\*:** This selector called _'universal'_ and use to select all the elements in the page, for example:

```CSS
*{
  margin: 10px;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: darkblue;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

_In this example:_ this style will be applied to `all` the elements in your page.

<br/>

**Descendant Selector:**
sometimes you need to access selectors that be inside other selectors(not single selectors as the previous examples), in this cases you need to use the _Descendant Selector_, you can use it by adding a `space` between the selectors, for example:

```CSS
section p {
  border: 2px solid red;
  text-align: center;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

_In this example:_ this style will be applied on all p elements which be inside a section element (direct child and not direct child).

**HTML Example for the direct child and not direct child:**

```HTML
<!-- This p is a direct child for the section -->
<section>
  <p>This paragraph is inside the section</p>
</section>

<!-- This p is not a direct child for the section but it is a direct child for the article -->
<section>
  <article>
    <p>This paragraph is inside an article which is inside a section</p>
  </article>
</section>
```

**Grouping Selectors:**
_you can add the same style for many selectors, you just need to separate between them with commas, for example:_

```CSS
h4, h6, p, section {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 25px;
  text-align: center;
}
```
