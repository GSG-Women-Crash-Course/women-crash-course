# Pull Requests

**Your checklist for pull requests**
- [ ] Make sure you are requesting to push to a topic/fix branch. Don't push to the master!
- [ ] Check the commit's or even all commits' messages styles match our requested structure.
- [ ] Check any code additions in the content you add, make sure they follow best practice and that they actually work. 

**Description**
* Please describe your pull request.
  * Provide a brief description of the change in the first line.
  * Insert a single blank line after the first line.
  * Provide a detailed description of the change in the following lines, breaking paragraphs where needed.
  * The first line should be limited to 50 characters and **should not end with a period.**
  * Link to an issue tracker â€“ if you are working with an issue tracking system (like Jira), it is important to create a logical link between the issue ticket number and the subsequent code change.

**The main rule to follow is:**
> The commit message must contain all the information required to fully understand & review the patch for correctness. Less is not more. More is more.
